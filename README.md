# ECE470 Robot Modeling and Control

## Course Description
ECE470 focuses on the fundamentals of robot modeling and control. Students engage in hands-on labs to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios involving robotic manipulators.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Forward and Inverse Kinematics for the PUMA 560 Manipulator
The purpose of this lab is to derive the forward and inverse kinematics equations for the PUMA 560 robot, to implement these equations as Matlab functions, and to use these functions to perform basic computer simulations.

### Lab 2: Forward and Inverse Kinematics for the KUKA Robotic Arm
The purpose of this lab is to adapt the results of lab 1 for implementation in a real robot. The objective is to make the robot arm draw on paper.

### Lab 3: Motion Planning for the PUMA 560 Manipulator
The purpose of this lab is to develop a Matlab function that performs a motion planning algorithm. The function will use artificial potential fields to find a path from an initial point and orientation in task space to a final point and orientation in task space while avoiding obstacles modeled as cylinders and spheres.

### Lab 4: Motion Planning and Obstacle Avoidance with the KUKA Robotic Arm
The purpose of this lab is to adapt the results of Lab 3 for implementation in a real robot. The objective is to use the artificial potential algorithm to make the KUKA robotic arm pick up an object and drop it in a cup while avoiding obstacles that are placed in the workspace.
