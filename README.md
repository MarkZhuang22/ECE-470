# ECE470 Robot Modeling and Control

## Course Description
ECE470 focuses on the fundamentals of robot modeling and control. Students engage in hands-on labs to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios involving robotic manipulators.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Kinematic Models
Introduction to kinematic models of robotic manipulators, with hands-on activities to implement forward and inverse kinematics using MATLAB.

### Lab 2: Trajectory Planning
Explores techniques for planning robot trajectories, ensuring smooth and accurate movements in simulated environments.

### Lab 3: Sensory Feedback and Control Systems
Students implement control systems and integrate sensory feedback to enhance the precision and adaptability of robotic manipulators.

### Lab 4: Advanced Manipulation Techniques
Covers advanced topics, including dynamic modeling and control for handling complex tasks with robotic arms.
